## Making Process

This project was developed using the following steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£. **Data Collection**: Gathered a dataset of movies with relevant features such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew.

2Ô∏è‚É£. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and preprocessed the data to handle missing values, normalize text, and create a unified feature set.

3Ô∏è‚É£. **Feature Engineering**: Combined relevant features into a single 'tags' column and applied text processing techniques like tokenization, stemming, and                  vectorization.

4Ô∏è‚É£. **Model Training**: Used cosine similarity to compute similarities between movies based on their feature vectors.

5Ô∏è‚É£. **Web Development**: Built a user-friendly web interface using Django to allow users to select a movie and get recommendations.

6Ô∏è‚É£. **Deployment**: Deployed the application on a local server for testing and demonstration purposes.

‚úÖ Whole process is done in Jupyter Notebook. see MRS_Notebook.ipynb file for more details.
